Hey! I am a senior studying Applied Math-Computer Science at Brown University. Currently, I am focused on gaining more professional experience within the realm of industry and research. I have a strong enthusiasm for healthcare applications, and a significant portion of my research has been motivated by collaborative efforts with hospitals seeking to enhance the quality of life of their patients and operations. In my free time, I like to explore the outdoors and try new foods!
