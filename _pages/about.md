Hey! I am a first-year masterâ€™s student at the MIT [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu) advised by Professor [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.dbertsim.mit.edu), where I focus on applying optimization and data-driven methods to healthcare. Much of my research is inspired by collaborations with hospitals that aim to improve both patient quality of life and operational efficiency. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, playing strategy card games, and trying new foods!
