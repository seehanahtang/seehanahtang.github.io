Hey! I am a first-year master’s student at the MIT [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu) advised by Professor [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.dbertsim.mit.edu). My research sits at the intersection of optimization, machine learning, and healthcare, with a focus on building data-driven tools that meaningfully improve patient outcomes and clinical operations.

Currently, I am involved in the Holistic AI in Medicine team in collaboration with Hartford Healthcare, leading a project for bloodstream infection detection, where we leverage multimodal AI to reduce unnecessary blood cultures in the emergency department without missing high-risk patients. I am also involved in the Unified Diagnostics initiative, applying multiomics data to enable earlier and more precise disease detection. 

Outside of research, I play flute in the MIT Symphony Orchestra, am an avid traveler, and enjoy puzzling and strategy card games. 

If any of this overlaps with your interests, feel free to reach out!
